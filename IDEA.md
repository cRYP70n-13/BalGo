# My own load balancer for fun

[x] - Read the config of our load balancer from a config file `yaml` maybe ?
[x] - Create a webserver that listens on port 80
[x] - Accept HTTP requests and send some response back
[ ] - Extend our logic for multiple backend servers
[ ] - Forward the requests to the backend servers, basically we gonna do round robbin.
[ ] - The logic of the load balancer, which endpoint we gonna have etc ..
[ ] - Perform some periodic health checks on the given servers
[ ] - Custom load balancing algorithms, (Maybe we will find out)
[ ] - Maybe add HTTP keep-alive.
